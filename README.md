# LPC Implementation of a Speak&Spell machine
The aim of this project is to explore the powerfulness of Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) as a tool to perform speech coding, through a didactic yet insightful application.

## What are the goals?
* Implement the LPC-10 coding algorithm in MATLAB, including the computation of LPC coefficients from speech frames;
* Reconstruct the speech signal from the LPC parameters;
* Evaluate the quality of the reconstructed signal compared to the original.
